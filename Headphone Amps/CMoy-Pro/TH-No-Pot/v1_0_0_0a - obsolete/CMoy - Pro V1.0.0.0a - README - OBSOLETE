CMoy - Pro V1.0.0.0a - Readme - OBSOLETE

Info:
This headphone amp is designed to test op-amps without any buffers. This amp can use any dual
op amp such as the AD8620 or a TI Burr-Brown op-amp. 

ERROR - Board:

The board for this version of the amp has an error. There is a trace missing between C2_6 and
R2_R. The trace is suppose to run from the headphone jack to C2_R, which then has a trace that 
connects to R2_R. This trace is to connect the right headphone positive input to virtual ground
through the 100K resistor.

TEMP FIX:
This error can be resolved on this board by connecting a wire from the post of C2_R that connects
to the headphone jack to the post of R2_R that is closest to C2_R.
